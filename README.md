# Date-And-Time-Utility-Project

Date and time utility project using C++. I will deliver a single-file C++ program that provides useful date and time functionalities. 
Typical utilities include showing the current date/time,
formatting date/time, calculating differences between dates or times, 
and converting time zones (if suitable).

Features:
Display current date and time.
Format date/time output.
Parse date/time input.
Calculate difference between two dates.
Optionally show UTC and local time.
Use only standard C++ libraries to keep it portable and easy to run.
The code will be clean, well-commented, and user-friendly with a simple menu-driven interface.
